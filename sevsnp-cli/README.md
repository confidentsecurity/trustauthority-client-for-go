# Intel速 Trust Authority Azure SEVSNP CLI

The Intel速 Trust Authority Azure SEVSNP CLI is a command line interface for attesting a Azure SEV-SNP CVM with Intel Trust Authority. The CLI must be installed and run inside the Azure SEV-SNP CVM. 

**The sevsnp-cli and go-sevsnp are exclusive beta preview features that are designed to work only within the Intel速 Trust Authority Pilot environment. To access these features, you must have a service offer for the Intel速 Trust Authority Pilot. The development of this branch is ongoing, and we encourage you to report any issues you encounter to the product team.**
